          <h3>Method</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this
              easier.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer
              = crispier fries)
            </li>
            <li>
              Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6
              minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time,
              they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper
              towel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown,
              about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt.
              Serve with ketchup!
            </li>
            <li>4 white rolls</li>
            <li>few round lettuce leaves, torn</li>
            <li>1 beef tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>ketchup, to serve (optional)</li>
